Diagnosis 

Walkthrough your approach 

In order to investigate the drop, I need to see the time series aspect..

1. TIME : Is the drop gradual or sudden ? Is it seasonal ? 
- The reason I want to look at this is because if its a 20% sudden drop , there could be a bug or a mirco economic change like COVID, that caused this drop. Or a gradual drop because of user interests decline. Or seasonal drop as jackets would go as per season of the year..

2. FUNNEL : In Which conversion step we could see the drop occur ?
- The reflection : user visiting page, signing up, logging in ,searching ,adding item to cart & purchasing the product. 
- There could be a bug or breakage or user experience friction causing this drop 

3. REGIONAL : Is it globally or regionally ? 
- Is the drop globally or regionally ? In specific country or continent or regions ?

4. DEVICE : Is this only on iOS or Android ? 
- There could be potential bug in any of those, outage in any of those could cause drop.

5. PRODUCT : Is this drop for all products ?
- Decompose into various products..Digital services like Kindle, Audio, video..
- Is this drop on entire platform or feature level or specific product.. 

6. COMPETITION: Is this decline for other companies or competitiors aswell ?
- This drop could be possible for other companies like walmart aswell..
