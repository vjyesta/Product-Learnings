Brainstorming Ideas : 

Research : Get to know throughly about business model, UI & UX.

Shortcuts : Look for shortcuts, if there a task with 5 steps, can you reduce it to 3 steps ? ( any unnecessary steps)

Segmentation : Is there a segment of users that are underserved ?

Monetization : Is there a better way for monetization ?

Like : 

1. Recommendation for following users : "Add creators like this" -- Shortcut
2. Raise the video length to 15 mins. -- Better serving 
3. Enable creators to sell products on their page -- Monetization
