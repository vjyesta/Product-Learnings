Should you build a feature ? 

Step 1: Define Business Goal 
- Ask questions or make assumptions to frame the probem 

Step 2: Walk through user journey 
- explain the key steps / user journey or new procedure for users.

Step 3: Analyse user behaviour 
- discuss how you would conduct data analysis to measure usage 

Step 4: Run an experiment
- Design an experiment to test the feature

Example : Should Tik Tok raise the video length to 15 mins ?

Step 1 : Define Business goal  

Tik Tok is a platform where users post short catchy videos.

Current video length : 10 mins 

This increase in 5 mins in videos could increase new audiences from youtube or podcasts, also improve growth, user engagement & monetization 
 
Step 2: User Journey 

explaining the key steps of user journey and proposed user journey 

- User Type - Who are the main users of the product ? ( Creators, Viewers & Advertisers)
     -- Viewers, creators are main in our example..

- Current journey - What is the current user journey to complete the task ?
    -- Viweres : Signup, signin , view the videos < 10 mins
    -- Creators : Signup, signin , post the videos < 10 mins

- New Proposed journey - What is the proposed new user journey to complete the task ?
     -- Viweres : Signup, signin , view the videos < 15 mins
     -- Creators : Signup, signin , post the videos < 15 mins

Journey is same only the time changes, it will effectly make differnce for creators..


Step 3: User Behaviour 

- Surveys : Has there been requests from users regarding this feature 
    -- email surveys; in-app surveys

- Proxy behaviour : Is there existing user behaviour that suggests user that wants this feature. 
   -- Look at the video distribution length per age group. Different age groups have different taste. Older generation would prefer lengthy videos, younger generation would prefer short vidoes.
-- Check mean median of the age group and video distribution length..

Step 4: Run an experiment 

Design an experiment. Sould tiktok raise to 15 mins ? 

Can you run a ab experiment ? 

Users : 10 

We take 10 users in the experiment. 

We randomly assign 50% of users to <=10 mins -- control group  and assign 50% of users to <=10 mins -- treatment group 

Run the experiment and gather results. 

What can go wrong in the experiment ? 

- Suppose a user from treatment group is friend with control group, and this user decides to post 15 mins.
but the other friend in control group cant post 15 mins video.
- it means that the user from control group is aware of the change in the treatment group, so this can have a spill over effect.
- So, when we see the results, there could be diluted results due to the consequences of spill over..

-- Can be done Geo based or country based raondomization or clustering..

Control : Country A , B
Treatment : Control C, D 

But treatment group can post vidoes < 10 or < 15 mins, using the treatment is optional, this could have a impact called "Response Bias" 

To migitate this bias, we need to apply casual inference. 

Apply casual inference --> regression discontinuity 

Average weekly hours per user.. 
Post launch and Pre launch..

We will see a regression discontinuity..


How to prioritize feature ? should we build feature x or feature y ?

Step 1: Define Business Goal 
- Ask questions or make assumptions to frame the probem 

Step 2: Walk through user journey 
- explain the key steps / user journey or new procedure for users.

Step 3: Analyse user behaviour 
- discuss how you would conduct data analysis to measure usage 

Step 4: Priortize a feature
- Apply a priortization framework to determine which feature to build

Example : Should TikTok build Tiktok live or increase the video length to 15 mins ? 

Step 1: Define the business goal 

TikTok is platform which allows users to post, watch short and catchy videos. 

Currently the video length is 10 mins. 

Tiktok live would allow users to engage with their followers real time.

Need to identify the next feature that can expedite user engagement, growth & monetization
 

Step 2: User Journey 

explaining the key steps of user journey and proposed user journey 

- User Type - Who are the main users of the product ? ( Creators, Viewers & Advertisers)
     -- Viewers, creators are main in our example..

- Current journey - What is the current user journey to complete the task ?
    -- Viweres : Signup, signin , view the videos < 10 mins
    -- Creators : Signup, signin , post the videos < 10 mins

- New Proposed journey - What is the proposed new user journey to complete the task ?
     -- Viweres : Signup, signin , view the videos < 15 mins or watch a recored video
     -- Creators : Signup, signin , post the videos < 15 mins or stream video


Step 3: User Behaviour 

- Surveys : Has there been requests from users regarding this feature 
    -- email surveys; in-app surveys

- Proxy behaviour : Is there existing user behaviour that suggests user that wants this feature. 
   -- Look at the video distribution length per age group. Different age groups have different taste. Older generation would prefer lengthy videos, younger generation would prefer short vidoes.
   -- Live video - Look at the external traffic for similar sites like youtube, instagram, twitch with links on the user profile for real time..

-- Check mean median of the age group and video distribution length..

Step 4: Priortize the feature 

-- Effort Impact Matrix 

High     Easy wins             Big bets

Impact

Low     Incremental           Money pit

          Low         Effort    High


Focus on low effort and high impact ones first..
then focus on high effort and high impact..depending on business..

Effort Low     -  small change 2-4 weeks of effort

Effort High    -  big change > 4 weeks of effort ; cross functional

Impact Low     -   button change (no significant change on gains for usage)

Impact High    -    new feature (significant change on gains for usage)


Raise a video low effort high impact

Live video high effort high impact

So, raising the video length can be priortized over live video..
