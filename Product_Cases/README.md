# product-cases

- Solving product cases improves product knoweldge, product exceution and applied statistics. 

Different product sense case studies 

- Measure Product Quality (Measure Success of a Product)

- Metrics Investigation (Revenue decreased or like/share/views decreased. Why?)

- Product Improvement (Implement any new changes in product)


For any product case study we need to cover three aspects 

- Product Sense : Need to provide product overview to make sure we have enough knoweldgeo n product.

- Technical Knoweldge : Data Intution (Metrics,Analysis & Statistics)

- Communication : Clearly understand the product problem to improve/design in better way.
