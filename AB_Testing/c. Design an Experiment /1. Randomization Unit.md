Randomization Unit 

An entity that is randomly assigned to a group in an experiment.

Suppose in AB Test, you have 10 users..

You will split them randomly into 2 groups 

1. First group with Blue SignUp button --> control group 
2. Second group with Green SignUp button --> treatment group


Randomization eliminates bias..Also in real randomization the split wont be 50-50..
