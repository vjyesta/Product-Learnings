NSM - accessibility to entertainment via Media - # of subscribers per year
AB Test -- Test the recommendation system for better user experience
Driver Metrics - Avg daily time mins consumed per user
Guardrail Metrics - revenue per day,signup per day, cancellation per day
Validity Metrics - sample ratio mismatch (SRM), AA test, the novelty effect check
Secondary Metrics - avg count of search per user, avg views per user, avg time mins browsing per user
Segmentation Metircs - Location - per continent, per country ; Device - Iphone/Android ; Browser - Chrome/Firefox/IE.
