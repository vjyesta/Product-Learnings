Statistical Power 

It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that effect exists, or that the alternative hypothesis is true.

alpha - 0.05 
p value - 0.03
(p vaue < alpha, then reject the null hypothesis)

How do you know how well you detected effect ?

Not only because of rejecting it with p value,actually the effect is detected or not..

To support it further , statistical power comes in..

-- The region to the right of critical value in any distribution , under the alternative hypothesis is Statistical Power..

-- The region to the left of critical value is Type II Error..It represents the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when the effect exists..

Power Range : 
In practice, the higher the power its more better..
-- In most AB Testing 0.80 is used..


Moderate Detection Range (0.70) : If limited population, finte sample size with limited time
High Detection Range (0.80) : 
Very High Detection Range (0.90) : If test failed at 0.80, or rerunning the test, and data team is confident that effect exists..

The longer time and longer sample size..the power will be high..


In our netflix scenario -- It would be 0.80 as statistical power..
