Clarifying the Business Problem is important, before running any experiment. 

To understand the business problem, these are 5 core sections one needs to be aware of : 

- Goal : What is the Business and product goal of the experiement ? (what are we trying to acheive ?)
- Key Members - Who will sponsor the product idea and the team to execute the idea ?
- KPIs : Whats the KPI that needs to be considered in the experiment ?
- Launch Criteria : How to do you quantitatively determine if the experiment was successful ? 
- Data : Whats the data required to perform the experimentation ?
